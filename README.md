## Tenative Stage of the Project:
We have wrapped up the initial code for the project, and will be moving into finalizing the code and answering my research questions in depth in the next deliverable. 
The models seem to have some issues with the performance as accuracy is quite low on all of the models. This indicates to me that before submitting my final code I will need to review how I have selected variables and if there are any issuse in my training / test set.

**Models Chosen:**
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
